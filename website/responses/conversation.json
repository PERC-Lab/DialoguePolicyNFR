      "bot_reply": "Running repo searches to find authentication, access control, logging, and malware-related code to map NFRs to code locations.\n\nBelow are concise evaluations for NFRs 31\u201340 with level, why, and relevant code locations.\n\nNFR 31 \u2014 Protect clearinghouse ePHI from larger org  \n- Level: Weakly Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: Role-based separation and access controls exist (Role enum, auth checks) plus transaction/audit logging to record accesses, but there is no explicit organizational policy/procedure documentation or enforcement controls in code to isolate the clearinghouse from other org units.  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../model/old/enums/Role.java; src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/AuthDAO.java (role/password APIs); src/main/.../action/EditPersonnelAction.java (role checks); src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/TransactionDAO.java and src/main/.../logger/TransactionLogger.java (audit logging); WebRoot/auth/hcp/auditPage.jsp; WebRoot/privacyPolicy.jsp; WebRoot/WEB-INF/web.xml.\n\nNFR 32 \u2014 Policies/procedures for granting ePHI access  \n- Level: Weakly Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: Code supports account creation/role assignment and admin personnel operations (so system-level granting mechanisms exist), but there is no code implementing formal approval workflows, documented provisioning steps, or procedural controls (e.g., request/approve flows).  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/AuthDAO.java (addUser, resetPassword); src/main/.../action/AddHCPAction.java, AddUAPAction.java, EditPersonnelAction.java; admin JSPs under WebRoot/auth/*.\n\nNFR 33 \u2014 Establish user's right of access based on org authorization policies  \n- Level: Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: Authorization checks are implemented in many action classes (authDAO.getUserRole used to gate behavior), and container-based authentication is configured (web.xml), so rights are enforced in code per role.  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../action/EditPersonnelAction.java, many action classes checking authDAO.getUserRole(...); src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/AuthDAO.java; WebRoot/WEB-INF/web.xml.\n\nNFR 34 \u2014 Document a user\u2019s right of access based on authorization policies  \n- Level: Weakly Denied  \n- Reasoning: There is minimal end-user privacy text (privacyPolicy.jsp) and test plans, but no clear, maintained mapping/document that documents each role\u2019s rights or a procedural record of assigned rights (policy docs absent in repo).  \n- Relevant locations: WebRoot/privacyPolicy.jsp; WebRoot/util/blackbox/BlackBoxTestPlan.xml (tests, not formal policy). No dedicated access-rights policy files found.\n\nNFR 35 \u2014 Procedures to review a user\u2019s right of access  \n- Level: Weakly Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: The system provides audit logs, an access-log viewer, and an operational profile (so manual review is possible), but there is no automated/scheduled review workflow or role-review UI/notifications to operationalize periodic reviews.  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/TransactionDAO.java (getRecordAccesses, getOperationalProfile); src/main/.../action/ViewMyAccessLogAction.java; WebRoot/auth/hcp/auditPage.jsp; src/main/.../logger/TransactionLogger.java.\n\nNFR 36 \u2014 Procedures to modify a user\u2019s right of access  \n- Level: Weakly Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: Code allows creating, editing and disabling personnel and changing roles (admin actions exist), but lacks formal change-control/approval, audit-of-changes UI, or documented procedure flows for role changes.  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../action/EditPersonnelAction.java; AddHCPAction.java, AddUAPAction.java, AddPHAAction.java; src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/AuthDAO.java (addUser, resetPassword).\n\nNFR 37 \u2014 Procedures for guarding against malicious software  \n- Level: Weakly Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: Input validation and upload checks (CSV parsing, file-type checks) and rejecting binary uploads reduce malware risk on file upload paths, but there is no AV/EDR integration, CI dependency scanning, sandboxing, or malware-scanning hooks.  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../action/AddPatientFileAction.java; src/main/.../CSVParser.java; WebRoot/auth/hcp-uap/uploadPatientFile.jsp; tests under src/test/.../UploadPatientFileTest.java show upload validation.\n\nNFR 38 \u2014 Procedures for detecting malicious software  \n- Level: Denied  \n- Reasoning: No malware-detection code, scanners, IDS/heuristics, or integration points (no antivirus scanning of uploads, no malware-alerting), beyond basic validation.  \n- Relevant locations: none found \u2014 search for \"scan\", \"virus\", \"malware\" returned no relevant detection code.\n\nNFR 39 \u2014 Procedures for reporting malicious software  \n- Level: Denied  \n- Reasoning: No incident reporting/alerting workflow, no telemetry/alerting integration or dedicated incident-reporting APIs found in the codebase.  \n- Relevant locations: none found in repo.\n\nNFR 40 \u2014 Procedures for monitoring log\u2011in attempts and reporting discrepancies  \n- Level: Satisfied  \n- Reasoning: Login failures are tracked (loginfailures table via AuthDAO.recordLoginFailure/getLoginFailures), LoginFailureAction implements blocking/CAPTCHA logic, and transactions/logging record login success/failure; UI references failure counts and CAPTCHA.  \n- Relevant locations: src/main/.../model/old/dao/mysql/AuthDAO.java (recordLoginFailure, getLoginFailures, resetLoginFailuresToZero); src/main/.../action/LoginFailureAction.java; WebRoot/loginMenu.jsp; src/main/.../model/old/enums/TransactionType.java (LOGIN_FAILURE, LOGIN_SUCCESS); transaction logging in TransactionDAO/TransactionLogger.\n\nIf useful, next steps can be: 1) map each Denied/Weak area to specific remediation actions (e.g., add AV scanning for uploads, add documented access-rights matrix, add periodic review scheduler), or 2) produce a prioritized checklist and sample CI/CD integration points to fix NFR 37\u201339.
