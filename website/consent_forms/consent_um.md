You are invited to participate in a research project being conducted by <em>Ali Pourghasemi Fatideh</em>, a graduate student at the School of Computing and Information Science at the University of Maine under the supervision of assistant professor <em>Dr. Sepideh Ghanavati</em> at the University of Maine in the School of Computing and Information Science. The Goal of this study is to create dialogues that demonstrate how to evaluate Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).

**What are Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)?** NFRs specify how a system should perform rather than what it should do. While functional requirements define specific behaviors or functions (e.g., "User can reset password"), NFRs establish quality attributes and constraints, such as security, performance, reliability, usability, and compliance (e.g., "System must reset password within 3 seconds").
**What is HIPAA?** HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a U.S. federal law that establishes privacy and security standards for the protection of sensitive patient health information. It requires healthcare providers, insurers, and their business associates to implement safeguards to ensure that **Protected Health Information (PHI)** remains confidential, secure, and accessible only to authorized individuals.


**What Will You Be Asked to Do?**
In this study, you will work with our chatbot that evaluates whether the given app is HIPAA-compliant by assessing a set of NFRs. The chatbot will perform the actual evaluation of each NFR by analyzing the app's code and implementation. Your role is to ask questions and interact with the chatbot to understand its assessment. Through your dialogue with the chatbot, you will realize the degree to which each NFR is satisfied, the reasoning for it, and the locations where it is implemented.

**Input:** You will be provided with:

- Up to thirty NFRs related to HIPAA compliance
- A chatbot that can analyze the app's code and assess NFR satisfaction
- The app's codebase
- A form to indicate whether you agree with the Chatbot's assessment

**The chatbot**'s role is to evaluate the app's code and determine how well each NFR is satisfied and where in the code it is implemented. 

**Your role** is to ask questions, seek clarifications, give advice, and request additional information from the chatbot as needed. Through these dialogues with the chatbot, you will gather the chatbot's assessments, reasoning, and code location for each NFR. Note that the chatbot performs the final evaluation; you only interact collaboratively with the LLM and indicate whether you agree or disagree.

**Output:** For each NFR, after interacting with the chatbot, you will provide an answer to the following questions:

- Question 1: Whether you agree with the chatbot's satisfaction level assessment
- Question 2: Whether you agree with the chatbot's reasoning
- Question 3: Whether you agree with the chatbot's identified code locations

Options: Agree, Partially agree, Partially disagree, and Disagree.

If you do not agree, you will provide your own assessment.

After completing the experiment, you will complete a brief survey about your satisfaction with the chatbot.

The study should take you approximately 60 minutes.

## Risks:
There are no risks associated with participating in this survey other than your time and inconvenience.

## Benefits:
There are no direct benefits to you.

- This research may help us learn more about the software development process of developers. That information will support our work in developing a tool-supported framework, methods and algorithms to help improve the software development concepts. 
- This research may support our work in developing evaluation methods to assess AI-based dialogue assistants for Non-Functional Requirements analysis.

## Compensation:
Upon reaching the end of this study, you will be redirected to a survey to enter your email address. The first 15 participants to participate in the study will receive a $10 Amazon gift card which will be sent to the address you entered in the survey. You must reach the end of the study to be eligible for the gift card without skipping any questions. Participants shall receive their gift card within 30 days of their submission and all gift cards will be sent latest by 6/31/26.

## Confidentiality
This study is anonymous; please do not include your name anywhere in the study. We do not collect any personal information during the study. After sending your compensation, we will delete your account and the associated response from our tool by July 30th, 2026. We will store your anonymized data on a password-protected, secure cloud storage drive indefinitely. Your responses from the previous study will not be linked with this study.

## Voluntary
Participation is voluntary. You are asked to answer all questions to the best of your ability. If you start the survey and do not wish to continue, you may stop at any time, and your responses will not be submitted.
