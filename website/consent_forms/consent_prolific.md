You are invited to participate in a research project being conducted by <em>Ali Pourghasemi Fatideh</em>, a graduate student at the School of Computing and Information Science at the University of Maine under the supervision of assistant professor <em>Dr. Sepideh Ghanavati</em> at the University of Maine in the School of Computing and Information Science. The Goal of this study is to create dialogues that demonstrate how to evaluate Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). You must be at least 18 years old to participate in this study. You must also have at least two years of experience in software development.

**What Will You Be Asked to Do?**
In this study, you will work with our chatbot that evaluates software requirements by assessing a set of NFRs, up to 10 in total. The chatbot will perform the actual evaluation of each NFR by analyzing the app's code and implementation. The study is divided into three parts. In the first part, you will review the NFRs. In the second part, you will ask questions and interact with the chatbot to understand its assessment. Through your dialogue with the chatbot, you will understand the degree to which each NFR is satisfied, the rationale for it, and where it is implemented. In the third part, you will be asked whether you agree with the chatbot's assessment. After participating in the experiment, you will participate in a brief survey about your satisfaction with the chatbot. At the beginning of the study, you will be asked whether you are willing to briefly turn on your camera. This is a simple, one-time verification step to confirm that responses are being provided by a real human participant and not an automated system or bot. No images or recordings will be captured, stored, or used in any way, and the session will not be recorded. If you do not wish to turn on your camera, you may choose to exit the study. More instructions will be provided after reading this form and in the tool. The study should take you approximately 60 minutes.

## Risks:
- There are no risks associated with participating in this survey other than your time and inconvenience.

## Benefits:
- There are no direct benefits to you.
- This research may help us identify the challenges of AI-based tools that assist developers in analyzing and ensuring compliance with Non-Functional Requirements.


## Compensation:
Upon reaching the end of the study, your account associated with your Prolific ID will be credited with $15, per your contract with Prolific. But you must answer every question and complete your study to receive compensation.

## Confidentiality
Your Prolific ID will be used to log you into our tool and to compensate you once you have participated in the study. After your compensation has been processed through Prolific, we will delete your account and the associated response from our tool by July 30th, 2026. We will store your anonymized data on a password-protected, secure cloud storage drive indefinitely.

## Voluntary
Participation is voluntary. You are asked to answer all questions to the best of your ability. If you start the survey and do not wish to continue, you may stop at any time, and your responses will not be submitted.
